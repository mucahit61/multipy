#summary How to create a server in multipy

= Import the library =
First off, import the multipy library

`import multipy`

You can alternatively import just the server base class

`from multipy import Server`

= Wrapping a class =
Multipy uses a base class for both server and client.
An example server class:
{{{
class BareBonesServer(multipy.Server):
    
    def on_receive(self, data):
        # data is the uncompressed packet
        pass
    
    def on_client_connect(self, cid):
        # cid is the id of the connected client
        pass
    
    def on_client_disconnect(self, cid):
        # cid is the id of the disconnected client
        pass
    
    def on_send(self, data):
        # data is the uncompressed packet
        pass
}}}
If it doesn't exist, the on_receive callback would forward the data received to each client but the sending client by default. In this example, it does nothing.
An example on_receive callback:
{{{
try:
	state, cid, data, rpc = data
except ValueError:
	print("packet could not be unpacked")
	
self.send(data, [ip for ip, entity in self.ip_dic.items() if entity.cid != cid])	
}}}
